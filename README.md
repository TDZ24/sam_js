# Experiment - Segment Anything
This project was an experimental endeavor that aimed to explore the implementation of "Segment Anything" using JavaScript. It was part of a series of tests conducted to assess the feasibility of the project, but unfortunately, it could not be formalized and completed as originally intended.

To utilize the models required for this project, please download the model folder directly from the GitHub repository of Facebook Research at https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything. The "Segment Anything" project being developed in that repository served as the basis for our experimentation.

Throughout the project, we conducted various tests using Jupyter Notebooks as well as JavaScript within Visual Studio Code. The goal was to ensure the successful execution and functionality of the project in a JavaScript environment.

Although this experimental project did not progress beyond the testing phase, it had a potential special focus on the field of medicine. The exploration of segmenting anything within medical imagery or related domains held promise for future advancements.

Please note that since this project was not formally realized, there might be limitations and incompleteness in the implementation. The provided GitHub repository may contain additional information and resources related to the "Segment Anything" project that could be of interest for further exploration.

This readme serves as a documentation of our failed experiment, highlighting the intent, scope, and technical aspects of the project.
